# transcript-parser
This app parses a UCSC style unofficial transcript course by course and calculates actual cumulative GPA, including F grades and repeat courses. P/NP attempted credits are not currently included in GPA calculation. The app consists of a basic dashboard-style overview including cumulative metrics, option to calculate GPA within a range of parsed quarters, a GPA graph to track trends over time, and an organized table of all courses you've taken.

I made this to find my true GPA that factors in all attempted credits (except P/NP) and allows you to easily find your GPA for the last two years (or whatever timeframe you want). I used electron to package this as an offline application for arm-64 macs. Download here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/172-yaMmirPfR-JF25VY7Z3WuWjlDvfVn/view?usp=sharing
